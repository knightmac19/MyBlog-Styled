            Commonly known in the English-speaking world as
            <em>"side control,"</em> this grappling position finds the top player
            perpendicular across their opponent's upper torso. However the Spanish
            and Portuguese names for this position -- <em>"cien kilos"</em> and
            <em>"cem kilos"</em> respectively ("one hundred kilos") -- more accurately
            describe what it feels like for the bottom player.

            <h3>What is side control?</h4>
            <img src="https://www.grapplearts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Side-Control-Pic-3.jpg">
            <p>Side control is much more than simply laying on top of your opponent. Even a significantly-heavier top player won't be very effective if they just lay on top of their opponent. Side control's effectiveness comes from the wedges the top player can employ against the bottom player.</p>

            <em><p>"Who cares, brother? Who cares? Today, today, today: smash." --Khabib Nurmagomedov</p></em>

            <p>While there are several variations of side control, a common one will see the two players chest to chest. The upper player will have one arm under their opponents head. The other arm will typically seek an underhook of the far arm of the bottom player. On the other side, the top player will establish two wedges with their knees: one to block the opponent's hip and the other set in between the ground and the opponent's shoulder. With this setup the top player will own all the inside real estate and the bottom player won't have any mechanical advantage to create space, escape, or ward off submission attempts.</p>

            <h3>Starting your escape: Elbows in</h4>
            <img src="https://www.grapplearts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Side-Control-Pic-19-300x165.jpg">
            <p>If the effectiveness of side control comes from the top player owning all the inside real estate, how can the bottom player escape? That's right -- by reclaiming the inside real estate.</p>

            <p>As the bottom player your first objective should be to bring your near-side elbow tight to your side, with the blade of your forearm at your opponent's hip. Your second objective is to bring your other forearm in between your chest and your opponent's chin, preferably with your elbow against your ribcage.</p>

            <em><p>"Bro, I don't need Jiu Jitsu. I just see red and it's over." --Your ex's new linkup</p></em>

            <p>Your best friend for creating space is the bridge. While this movement has its intricacies, the basic idea is to use the powerful muscle chain in your hips to move yourself and your still-attached opponent off the floor. When your hips return to the floor, capitalize on the momentary space to bring one or both elbows in.</p>

            <!-- <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hgy9JMwpCv8/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLDJCycbcTSbrH8IvdvpBra5TVuV0g"> -->

            <p>There's no guarantee this will be easy, and the order of these objectives may be interchangeable. <strong>It's important to remember, though, that the secret sauce to any escape is movement. Don't sit there like a limp noodle.</strong></p>

            <h3>Keep it moving: Frame and shrimp</h4>
            <img src="https://www.watchbjj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/side-control-escape-most-common-1024x576.jpg">
            <p>Your next goal will be to bring your near-side knee inside of the wedge established by the top player. You don't need to insert your entire shin -- that'll come in a moment. For now, focus on getting your knee in between your opponent's hip & stomach.</p>

            <p>At this point use the frames you've established to move your opponent off of you (the forearm in the chin really helps here). Slide yourself away from your opponent with a <a href="https://youtu.be/TY9j4mRfumE?si=0iOgZiD5CVJRpTkI&t=19">shrimping motion</a> so that you can bring your near-side shin in between yourself and your opponent.</p>

            <img src="https://www.bjj-world.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/side-control.jpg">
            <p>You're almost there. You want to contine shrimping one way and another as you continue to frame. This will allow you to bring your near-side knee to the other side. At this point you should have your opponent in between your legs, with your hips above theirs. Congratulations! You've managed to recover closed guard.</p>
